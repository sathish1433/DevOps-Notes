To re-use the block of statements in same script again and again. Instead of writing the statements again.

we will write block of statement in function and we will call when its required.

def functionname():

	<execute statements to be re-used>


How to call function 

functionname()


example

def f1():
    print ("All good")

print ("Starting of script")
f1()



def f1():
    print ("True")

for i in range(0,20,1):
    if (i == 10):
        f1()
    elif (i > 10):
        f1()
    else:
        print ("False")


output

C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\main.py 
False

Process finished with exit code 0



userinput=input("Enter the Number")
if (int(userinput) == 2):
    print ("True")
elif (int(userinput) == 5):
    print ("True")
else:
    print ("False")



output

C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\main.py 
Enter the Number2
True

Process finished with exit code 0

C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\main.py 
Enter the Number5
True

Process finished with exit code 0

C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\praveenkumar\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\main.py 
Enter the Number10
False

Process finished with exit code 0

we can see from above code  when user input is 2 or 5 its printng  "True" instead of this we can create function mention block which is repeating again so when condition matches we can call.
